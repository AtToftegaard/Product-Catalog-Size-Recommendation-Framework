# Product-Catalog-Size-Recommendation-Framework
This framework is based on the algorithm proposed in **Decomposing Fit Semantics for Product Size Recommendation in Metric Spaces**. It consists of collaborative filtering and metric learning components for predicting the fit of different catalog sizes of clothing products so as to recommend appropriately sized products to customers. 

## Prerequisites
* Install PyLMNN library from [here](https://pypi.org/project/PyLMNN/).
* Download the datasets from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/clothing-fit-dataset-for-size-recommendation).
